I took a series of images with my Raspberry Pi 3 B using a NoIR camera. The images were saved in JPEG (*.jpg) format. The file names are a timestamp with the following format:

- Year (4 digits) 
- Month (2 digits)
- Day (2 digits) 
- Underscore ('_')
- 24 Hour (2 digits) 
- Minute (2 digits) 
- Second (2 digits)

For example 20170115_222831 is the year 2017, the month January, the 15th day at 10:28pm and 31 seconds.
